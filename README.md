# Video Editing Script for Efficient Video Processing

## Project Overview
This script enhances video processing by dynamically adjusting frame rates, converting formats to H.265, and modifying playback speeds. It aims to optimize file sizes while maintaining high-quality video output.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- MoviePy library (`pip install moviepy`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Update the video file path in the script to match your desired input file.
3. Run the script using Python; it will process the video according to the specified settings.

## Features

### Dynamic Frame Rate Adjustment
Allows users to manually set the frame rate or automatically adjusts it for optimized processing.

### Scene Cutting
Enables precise scene selection for custom video editing needs.

### Mute Option
Provides an option to mute the video for privacy or background noise reduction.

### Parallel Processing
Leverages multiprocessing to distribute video processing across multiple CPU cores, enhancing efficiency.

### Playback Speed Adjustment
Facilitates easy adjustment of playback speed to balance between video length and quality.
